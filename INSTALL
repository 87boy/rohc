Requirements
------------

The library itself does not require external resources. Optional configure
flags require external resources:

 --enable-doc         requires doxygen and latex.
 --enable-rohc-stats  requires libpcap.
 --enable-rohc-tests  requires libpcap.




Libraries and tools
-------------------

Configure the libraries and tools:

 $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/installation/directory

  (use ./autogen.sh if you are building from the source repository)

Build the libraries and tools:

 $ make all

If you want to run all the automated tests:

 $ make -C test check

Install the libraries and tools:

 $ make install

The libraries are now located in the /path/to/installation/directory/lib
directory, the header files in the /path/to/installation/directory/include
directory and the tools in the /path/to/installation/directory/bin directory.

In case of problem:
 - check you got the last release of the library (see README),
 - contact the mailing list (see README),
 - check the bugtracker for known bugs (see README).


Documentation
-------------

HTML documentation can be generated from the source code thanks to Doxygen:

 $ ./configure --enable-doc
 $ make html

Open the ./doc/html/index.html file in your favorite web browser.


Non-regression tool
-------------------

Please, note that the non-regression tool is often used through the "make check"
command or the report tool described below because their interfaces are simplier.

Run the non-regression tool:

 $ ./test/non_regression/test_non_regression <smallcid OR largecid> <source PCAP file>

The application:
 - outputs the results (status & logs) in XML on stdout,
 - optionally outputs the ROHC packets in a PCAP file,
 - optionally compares the generated ROHC packets with ROHC packets given as
   input.

For usage details, run:

 $ ./test/non_regression/test_non_regression -h


Test and Statistic tool
-----------------------

A HTML summary of compression statistics may be generated:

 $ ./configure --enable-rohc-stats
 $ make -C statistics check

Open the ./statistics/html/index.html file in your favorite web browser.
