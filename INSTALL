Libraries
---------

Configure the libraries:

 $ ./configure

Build the libraries:

 $ make

Install the libraries:

 $ make install

The libraries are now located in the lib directory and the header files in the
include directory.

Documentation
-------------

HTML documentation can be generated from the source code thanks to Doxygen:

 $ make doc

Open the doc/html/index.html file in your favorite web browser.

Test application
----------------

Build the test application:

 $ make test

Specify the directory where the ROHC libraries are located:

 $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lib

Run the test application:

 $ ./test/test <source PCAP file>

The application:
 - outputs the results (status & logs) in XML on stdout,
 - optionally outputs the ROHC packets in a PCAP file,
 - optionally compares the generated ROHC packets with ROHC packets given as
   input.

For usage details, run:

 $ ./test/test -h

HTML report
-----------

To generate an HTML report of several predefined tests:

1. For each predefined test, create an new directory in the test/report/samples/
   directory and put the source.pcap (= IP flow) and the rohc.pcap (= dump of
   previously generated ROHC packets) into it. The report script will call the
   test application with the source.pcap and rohc.pcap files as input.

2. Edit the report configuration file to point to the directories defined in
   step 1. The configuration format is easy to understand.

 $ vim test/report/report.conf

3. Generate the HTML report:

 $ make report

4. Load the test/report/report.html file in your favorite browser and watch the
   results. In case of failure, the HTML page shows the logs, so you can find
   out the problem.

IMPORTANT: Run the report script after every library modification to avoid
           regressions.
