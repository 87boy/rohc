Introduction
------------

This piece of software is an implementation of RObust Header Compression for
Linux (or other Unix-compatible OS). The library can be used to add ROHC
compression/decompression capabilities to an application.

License
-------

The project is licensed under GPL, see COPYING for details.

Libraries
---------

The sources are in the src subdirectory. The sources are separated into three
libraries:
 - a library that contains the routines used for both the compression and the
   decompression processes
 - a library that handles the compression process
 - a library that handles the decompression process

See the INSTALL file to learn to build the libraries.

Tests
-----

The test subdirectory contains a test application. See the header of the test.c
file for details. There is also a report.sh script that tests the ROHC libraries
with several IP flows and outputs an HTML page with the test results.

See the INSTALL file to learn how to use the test application and the report.sh
script.

Statistics
-----
The statistics subdirectory contains a test and statistic application. The auto.pl
script outputs a HTML with the tests and statistics results.

The auto.pl script calls others scripts :
	test.sh : executes the tests list and generate the log -> list.txt
	analyse_log.pl : extracts information from the log
	gnuplot.sh : generates graphics
	stats.pl : generate the stats.html

See the INSTALL file to learn how to use the test and statistic application and the auto.pl
script.

Needs:
Perl, Gnuplot, Zenity
