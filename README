Introduction
------------

This piece of software is an implementation of RObust Header Compression for
Linux (or other Unix-compatible OS). The library can be used to add ROHC
compression/decompression capabilities to an application.

License
-------

The project is licensed under GPL, see the COPYING and AUTHORS files for more
details.


Libraries
---------

The sources are in the src subdirectory. The sources are separated into three
libraries:
 - a library that contains the routines used for both the compression and the
   decompression processes
 - a library that handles the compression process
 - a library that handles the decompression process

See the INSTALL file to learn to build the libraries.


Non-regression tests
--------------------

The test subdirectory contains a test application. See the header of the test.c
file for details. There is also a report tool that tests the ROHC libraries with
several IP flows and outputs an HTML page with the test results.

See the INSTALL file to learn how to use the non-regression and report tools.


Statistics
----------

The statistics subdirectory contains a test and statistic application. The auto.pl
script outputs a HTML with the tests and statistics results.

The auto.pl script calls others scripts :
 - test.sh         executes the tests list and generate the log -> list.txt
 - analyse_log.pl  extracts information from the log
 - gnuplot.sh      generates graphics
 - stats.pl        generate the stats.html

See the INSTALL file to learn how to use the test and statistic application and the auto.pl
script.

Requirements: Perl, Gnuplot, Zenity
