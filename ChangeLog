17 May 2012 - release 1.4.0
  Compatibility:
    Version 1.4.0 is not compatible with versions < 1.4.0 because of several
    fixes related to IETF RFCs that change the format of ROHC packets.
  License/Authors:
    Add Didier Barvaux's personal email address in addition to Viveris one.
  Acknowledgments for bug reports and/or bug fixes:
    Ahmed Fathy, Arne, FranÃ§ois W., hzkjdxwktx, Klaus Warnke, laAnna Hao,
    qingbaibai, Viveris Technologies.
  Main changes:
    Make the library completely thread-aware.
    Add new API method rohc_comp_get_last_packet_info() to retrieve some
	   information about the last compressed packet.
    Add several new API functions for getting descriptions on packet types,
      extension types, mode and states.
    Deprecate crc_init_table(), crc_get_polynom() and crc_table_X from API
	   (they are still available, but emit a warning).
    Rework list compression in a more understandable and robust way.
    Add a simple example program in subdir examples/.
    Remove the outdated "measures" directory.
    Remove context repair (maybe added again later).
    Update main and features pages in API documentation.
    Add new application and script to generate ROHC compression statistics
	   (old broken statistics scripts removed).
    Add new application for testing compression computing performance.
  Build system:
    Install README, INSTALL, COPYING, AUTHORS, ChangeLog files.
    Update the way API documentation is generated: configure option
      --enable-doc and 'make install' replace 'make doc'.
    Avoid installing private ROHC headers on the system during install.
    Make 'make' less verbose to get output like Linux kernel build.
    Remove useless or deprecated checks from configure.ac.
    Remove support for 'make report', 'make check' supersedes it.
    Configure: avoid adding -lpcap to LDFLAGS several times.
    Configure: add support for PACKAGE_URL.
    Fix build with CFLAGS="-DNDEBUG".
  Q&A:
    Move private functions/definitions from public headers to private headers.
    Clearly separate public and private functions in several files.
    Avoid useless system/internal header inclusions in order to reduce header
      interdependencies.
    Create enums for packet types, extension types, CID types and SDVL types.
    Remove the ugly internal boolean type.
    Remove duplicated checks for non-IPv4/IPv6 and fragmented packets.
    Check pointers against NULL instead of 0.
    Add many const and static keywords when appropriate.
    Add many nonnull and warn_unused_result attributes when appropriate.
    Use uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t and size_t instead of int or unsigned int
      when appropriate.
    Remove the 'version' fields in compression/decompression profiles.
    Fix print formats: use %u instead of %d if type is unsigned.
    Avoid modifying input parameters (data and length) in several functions.
    Add debug traces to help debugging.
    Add many assertion to ease debugging.
    Improve code style (uncrustify config file stored in contrib/).
    Improve English spelling.
    Remove some dead code.
    Improve the non-regression test application.
    Add new network captures for the non-regression test.
	 Add unit test for LSB encoding/decoding at wraparound.
	 Add functional test for FEEDBACK-2 packets.
	 Add robustness test for feedback-only packets.
    Add robustness test for damaged packet handling.
    Add robustness test for empty payload handling.
